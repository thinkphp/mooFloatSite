HOME.My name is Tim Wienk, as you probably already knew before you set foot on my website. I was born at April 3rd, 1989 as a 2.5kg / 5.5 lbs pile of meat. Now we're eighteen and a half years further on the road (November 2007) and there's about 30 times as much of me.
Mostly thanks to my dad I've been working and doing things with computers since I was a child. There's a Commodore 64 around the house somewhere, and most of the 80286s, 80386s and 80486s just moved out. When I was nine or ten years old (in 1999) I did a school presentation about "the computer". I took all the parts of an old 80286 computer with me to school, explained about the computer, named and explained about the different parts and put them all on the motherboard while doing that. At the end of the project I gloriously pressed the Power button and it booted Windows 3.11 without any trouble!
